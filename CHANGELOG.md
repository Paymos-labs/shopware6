### Added
- Initial release.
- USDT and USDC payments across 13 mainnet networks via the hosted Paymos checkout.
- Payment plugin for Shopware 6.5.7+ and 6.6 (async payment handler).
- Pre-registered webhook endpoint with HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Webhook-Signature`) verification and reverse-verification of terminal events.
- Idempotent webhook processing with event-id dedup and a roll-back guard that protects a paid transaction from a late downgrade.
- Order transaction state transitions driven by the SDK status mapper (no phantom statuses).
- Snippets for admin-facing labels (EN + RU).
- API credentials and signing secret pre-injected by the dashboard ZIP generator (the merchant types nothing).
- Sandbox / Live mode switch in the Shopware admin.
